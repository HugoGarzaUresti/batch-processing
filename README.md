# Batch Processing

This guide demonstrates how to perform batch processing in Python using CSV files. We will read data from a CSV file, process it, and write the results to another CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Setup

1. Ensure you have a CSV file named `input.csv` with appropriate data.

2. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python run.py
    ```

## Code Explanation

### `app/__init__.py`

This module contains functions to perform batch processing.

- **`read_data`**: Reads data from the input CSV file and prints it.
- **`process_data`**: Simulates data processing.
- **`write_data`**: Writes processed data to the output CSV file.

### `run.py`

This script serves as the entry point for the application. It calls the `main` function to perform batch processing.

## Additional Information

- You can modify the `input_file` and `output_file` variables in the `main` function to use different file paths.
- Ensure your CSV files have the correct format and headers.
